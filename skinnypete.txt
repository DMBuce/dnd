Backstory

Hi, my name's Peter Pugnus*. Folks call me Skinny Pete. I'm not much for words
or books or what-have-you, but ever since I gave up liquor my thoughts've been
wandering a bit much. Figured I'd put what the gears in my head have been
grindin' on into words. Maybe doin' that'll clear my mind a bit, Iunno.

Guess I'll start from the start. I grew up with my mom and dad. Most folks
prolly love their parents, but if I ever see mine again it'll be too soon. Mom
was a courier for the 11th regimen something-or-other**, pretty much just a
glorified mail-lady for the army. She was a total hardass. She'd beat the tar
outta me if I was too slow to do what she told me to or bein' bad or just
thinkin' 'bout bein' bad.

You'd think a hardass like that woulda married another hardass, but dad was
pretty much the opposite, a real nice guy. He was caring to a fault, never
wantin' no trouble and always eager to please. So much so, actually, that --
and I hate to say it -- but he was a pretty big pushover. He'd spend all day
serving the knight that led mom's battalion, Lord Douchebag*** or whatever his
name was, kissing his butt and shining his shoes. Then he'd come home and do
the same for mom. You'd think a man'd at least protect his own kin, but dad
bein' dad, wouldn't so much as bat an eye when mom turnt her belt on me.

Anyway, I weren't no more'n twelve years old before I high-tailed it outta
there and struck out on my own. I took to the streets, pickpocketing to get by
and tryin' to stay outta trouble. Weren't no good at either o' those things,
though, cuz I must've ended up in jail more'n a hundred times by the time I
was fifteen.

Round about then I found something I *was* good at -- fightin' and drinkin'
and fightin' drunk. I started hittin' the bottle pretty hard at Rough-Houser's
Bar, and there'd be a big brawl more nights than not. So I learnt pretty quick
how to handle myself in a fight. Dad always said I had an unnaturally tough
body and an unnatural grace, so it weren't long before I made a name for
myself as one of the scrawniest, toughest guys at the bar and folks started
callin' me Skinny Pete.

Some time later Mattrim GreyHammer caught wind of me and offered to let me
join the Gorum Gang(?). He put a roof over my head and I punched and kicked
whoever he told me to. We got a pretty good deal goin', and his cronies taught
me to fight real good, too. Honed my fists to the point where they could kill
a man instead o' just knockin' him out, which is pretty great if you ask me.

Anyway, that's been my life the past few years. Lately we swore off Mattrim
and started followin' Sarenrae, so I had to swear off the liquor. Otherwise
not much is new. Oh, except I saw my mom in the street the other day and
socked her one real good! That was pretty cool.
